#In the shell or in a text editor, write a program that
# asks for the user to sign up for Programmer's Toolkit Monthly Subscription Box.
# They must select level of membership they want.
# Each month is something different, t-shirts, stickers, figurines, even programming books!
#The levels are the following:
#Platinum  60$
#Gold      50$
#Silver    40$
#Bronze    30$
#Free Trial    Free $0.00
#Write an if statement that prints the cost for each of the level. Platinum is $60, each level below is 10 dollars cheaper, and the free trail is free.

#pseudocode

#tell the user what programmers toolkit is/contains
    #print something like these
        #"Sign up for Programmer's Toolkit Monthly Subscription Box"
        #"Each month is something different, t-shirts, stickers, figurines, even programming books!"
        #print possible levels they can select from
#ask user to select a membership level
    #grab user input somehow
    #cast this to something we can validate with basd on how we set up the level selection

#based on what level the user selected, print the cost of that level
    # if level is platinum
        #print something like "cost is $60 for Platinum"
    # else if level is gold
        #print something like "cost is $50 for Gold"
    #... etc
    #example 'ford' == 'ford' True
        #x = 'ford'
        # if (x == 'ford')
